*Project Helena
Note: No clones were harmed in the making of this project.

Project Helena is a database management system for equipment checkouts in an educational setting. It allows for easy tracking of equipment availability, checkout history, and policies. The project is named after Helena, one of the clones from the BBC TV series Orphan Black, who happens to be one of our favorite clones.

*Getting Started
To get started with Project Helena, you'll need to set up a MySQL database using the SQL code provided in this repository. Once the database is set up, you can start using the system to manage your equipment checkouts.

*Usage
The system allows for easy tracking of equipment availability, checkout history, and policies. You can view a list of all available equipment and check out equipment by specifying the ID of the equipment you wish to check out. You can also view a list of all checked out equipment and when they are due back.

*Contributing

Project Helena was created by Philip Fryer. It is named after Helena, one of the clones from the BBC TV series Orphan Black.
